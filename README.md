- 👋 Hi, I’m @sniperstyx
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, games design, level design and computer science.
- 🌱 First year of university is finished (out of 3).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever development team that needs a decent level designer (preferably in Source Engine).
- 📫 I should have ways to contact me somewhere on my profile.
